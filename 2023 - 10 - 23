Today, I dived into crafting digital art with pure CSS for a local gallery, playing with shapes and layersâ€”thank goodness for z-index! I made sure it looked good on any device, from desktops to phones, using flex and grid for layout magic. The trickiest part? Definitely getting those abstract shapes to vibe together harmoniously across different screens. I also whipped up a nifty little form for art lovers to drop their details for a digital purchase. High-fived myself when it all came together! ðŸŽ¨âœ¨ Oh, and shoutout to MDN docs for being my sidekick throughout this CSS adventure! ðŸŒŸ
